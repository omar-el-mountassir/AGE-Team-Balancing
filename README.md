## Overview

This bot helps Age of Empires 2 communities create fair and balanced teams for multiplayer matches. It's especially useful for communities with players of varying skill levels (ELO ratings ranging from 1100 to 2400).

### Key Features

- **Player Registration**: Register players with their Steam nicknames and automatically fetch their ELO ratings
- **Team Balancing**: Generate balanced team compositions based on player ELO and preferences
- **Position Optimization**: Suggest optimal positions (flank/pocket) for players based on their performance history
- **Civilization Suggestions**: Recommend civilizations based on position, map, and team composition
- **Match History**: Track game results and maintain statistics for players
- **API Resilience**: Fallback mechanisms to handle API unavailability

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- A Discord bot token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Access to the Discord server where you want to add the bot
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Setup Guide

1. **Get the code**:

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AGE-Team-Balancing.git
   cd AGE-Team-Balancing

   # Alternatively, download and extract the ZIP file from GitHub
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   # Create a virtual environment
   python -m venv venv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the bot**:

   ```bash
   # Create a configuration file
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Then edit the `.env` file with your settings. At minimum, you need to set:

   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token from the Discord Developer Portal

5. **Run the bot**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot doesn't respond to commands**:

   - Check if the bot is online in Discord
   - Verify that you've enabled the correct intents in the Discord Developer Portal
   - Ensure the bot has proper permissions in your server

2. **API errors when fetching ELO ratings**:

   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the API base URLs in your `.env` file
   - The APIs might be temporarily unavailable; the bot has fallback mechanisms

3. **Bot crashes on startup**:
   - Check your Discord token
   - Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed
   - Review the error logs for specific issues
