- ML model development (likely gradient boosting or neural network)
- Model evaluation and continuous improvement system
- A/B testing framework to compare ML vs. traditional balancing

**Benefits**:

- More accurate team balance predictions
- Adaptation to individual player strengths/weaknesses
- Learning from past game results to improve future balancing
- Consideration of additional factors beyond ELO (synergies, map preferences, etc.)

### 3. Web Interface

**Objective**: Create a companion web application for enhanced visualization and management.

**Key Components**:

- Backend API using FastAPI or Flask
- Frontend using React or Vue.js

### 4. Internationalization

**Objective**: Add support for multiple languages to make the bot accessible to the global AoE2 community.

**Key Components**:

- Translation framework implementation
- Language selection commands
- Community-contributed translations
- Auto-detection of user language preferences

**Benefits**:

- Inclusivity for non-English speaking communities
- Expanded user base
- Community engagement through translation contributions

### 5. Voice Channel Management

**Objective**: Automate the creation and management of team voice channels for games.

**Key Components**:

- Dynamic voice channel creation based on team compositions
- Automatic player movement between channels
- Temporary channel lifecycle management
- Permission handling for team-specific channels

**Benefits**:

- Streamlined organization of voice communication
- Automatic team grouping after team selection
- Improved user experience during game setup
